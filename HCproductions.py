#################### ham cheese production model ###################

### this is a model of making a ham and cheese sandwich

## the environment hasn't been built yet so print statements
## are used to state the actions of the agent

# this is the simplest type of act-r model
# it uses only the production system and one buffer
# the buffer represents the focus of thought
# we call it the focus buffer but it is often called the goal buffer
# productions fire if they match the focus buffer
# each production changes the contents of focus buffer so a different production will fire on the next cycle

# Python ACT-R requires an environment
# but in this case we will not be using anything in the environment
# so we 'pass' on putting things in there
